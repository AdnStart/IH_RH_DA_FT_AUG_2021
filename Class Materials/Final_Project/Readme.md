# Final Project Kickoff

## Scope

### Purpose
The aim of the final Project is to present the learners with a final opportunity to put their newly acquired skills into practice. The final project has to be scoped ad-hoc - case by case - both by the learner and the teaching staff. The ideal is that it represents enough of a challenge to learners, therefore they are pushed to extend their capabilities and refine their understanding of the different areas of Data Analysis. At the same time, the intention is NOT to provoque frustration or generate so much of a challenge for the learners to be unable to demonstrate skill. 

### Timeline 
Turn in all deliverables and meet all requirements by the end of Unit 9

### Learning Objectives: 
After this lesson, students will be able to: 

- Scope and manage a full data analysis project with minimal supervision
- Look for interesting challenges to solve using available data
- Identify the best approach to solve business problems using data analytics skills
- Use Tableau or Python visual libraries at a profesional level to visualize insights and present your work
- Select the algorithm, statistical methods or technical building blocks that could give the best results, most efficiently

## Presentation, Data Storytelling 

* [Python graph gallery](https://python-graph-gallery.com/all-charts/). A vast collection of matplotlib based (seaborn, matplotlib, pandas, etc.) plots with their respective code snippets. If you need a plot, pick one, check the code, copy-paste it and change it according to your needs
* [80 Data Visualization examples using location data and maps](https://carto.com/blog/eighty-data-visualizations-examples-using-location-data-maps/)
* [From Data to Viz - The ultimate guide to plotting](https://www.data-to-viz.com/), click the plot symbols to get Python code snippets shown
* [Makeover Monday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) , look at weekly project topics, access data sources and see how others visualised it 
* [information is beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/) , what can we add to the title ? 
* [storytelling with data](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog), the SWD challenge blog - highly recommended

### Evaluation 

> :exclamation: Teachers Note: This is a Summative Assessment. That implies that we're looking forward to checking if the students are not only able to apply the technologies, but also they have a higher-level understanding of the context of the problem, the implications of their decisions, and a general framework of reference - conversations around the topic, ethics, paradoxes, market cases, state of technology, etc. -. For every learner, what implies a challenge might differ and we should accommodate for that diversity to emerge, but we shouldn't "lower the bar" at the point that we don't understand whether this student is understanding what's going on or they are just repeating techniques without reflection on their practice. What we are asking here is basically to level up their degree of sophistication when demonstrating proficiency.
