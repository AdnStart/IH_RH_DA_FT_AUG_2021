1. - great presentation/documentation = content + design + delivery
2. - summarised information: No need to put every detail that you worked on (we know that you are working hard)
3. - simple and clear: not too much text, no complex charts
4. - show only the charts that makes sense:  if a pattern is not clear in a specific chart or you are unsure about the interpretation, then please don't add it
5. - every chart/plot has legend, title, differentiating colors and is easy to interpret.
6. - The presentation is there to support you in telling your data story and not to limit you.
7. - presentation that creates a contradiction
