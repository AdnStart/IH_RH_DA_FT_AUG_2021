**Lab Data Cleaning using SQL**

Please re-apply the data cleaning steps that you have performed previously(using Pandas)  on the Customer Analysis Case Study using SQL this time. You can find the previous lab in this [Link](https://github.com/raafat-hantoush/IH_RH_DA_FT_AUG_2021/blob/main/Class%20Materials/Pandas/Labs/Customer_Analysis_Case_Study/Activities.md)

You can find the csv file that contains data  in this  [Link](https://github.com/raafat-hantoush/IH_RH_DA_FT_AUG_2021/blob/main/Class%20Materials/Pandas/Labs/Customer_Analysis_Case_Study/Data_Marketing_Customer_Analysis_Round2.csv).

Once You finish cleaning and preparing  the data, please load  the cleaned data into a Pandas data Frame.

Hint: you can use Stored Procedures or Functions to organise your SQL operations.
